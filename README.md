# download-directory.github.io

Download just a sub directory from a GitHub repo.

For example, Three.js repo is more than 500MB and its archive is 200MB. What if you just want to download the `build` directory? Try this:

[**download-directory.github.io**`?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build`](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build)

This is an alternative to the existing [GitZip](https://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/) and [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/) but without the cruft.
